Geostorm is Natural phenomena linked to solar activity and impact communication, power, and navigation systems, but also create stunning aurora displays. Accurate prediction and mitigation strategies are crucial to safeguard infrastructure and human activities.

In this project we predicting geomagnetic storms on Earth using potentially flawed data from the aging Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR)

In our machine learning model we :
1- Utilized ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) for time series forecasting.
2- Aimed to predict the future planetary K index.
3- Utilized historical data obtained from DSCOVR.
4- Applied ARIMA to model and forecast the planetary K index based on past data.
